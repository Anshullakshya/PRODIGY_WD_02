🚀 Just completed building a Stopwatch Web Application! 🕒

I'm excited to share that I've successfully built a fully functional stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🌐

The application allows users to accurately measure time intervals with features like start, stop, lap, and reset functionalities. Plus, it displays lap times for easy tracking. 🏃‍♂️💨

I'm proud of this project as it not only honed my coding skills but also allowed me to create something practical and interactive. 💻✨
